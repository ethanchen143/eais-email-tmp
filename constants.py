Hi {lead_name}, <br>
        <p></p>
        Thank you so much for your response. I completely understand the 
importance of ensuring adequate compensation for your valuable work and 
influence. I truly respect your talent and the connection you have with your 
audience, which is why we reached out in the first place. <br>
        <p></p>
        I apologize, but at this time, we are unable to pre-pay for content before it 
is uploaded. Our company has invested heavily in developing cutting-edge 
technology to provide the most cost-effective and reliable products, which I 
believe is something you would want for your viewers as well. <br>
        <p></p>
        However, I would like to offer an alternative that I hope will be acceptable. 
We can execute a $94 per sell deal ($5 reservation + $84 final sale), a free 
machine(MSRP $599) is also included once 20 people are reserved through your 
link. Many influencers at your level have already been earning thousands of 
dollars in commission through our program. I believe this could be a great 
opportunity for you to earn a substantial amount while promoting a product that
aligns with your audience's interests. <br>
        <p></p>
        I hope we can find a way to collaborate that works for both parties. Please
